# 🗂️ Task Management Board

A fully responsive and theme-toggleable Task Management Board designed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aims to provide a clean and modern interface for managing tasks in a Kanban-style workflow. It is ideal for solo developers, small teams, or anyone needing a simple visual to-do system.

## 📖 Overview

This Task Management Board allows users to:

- Visually track tasks across "To Do", "Doing", and "Done" columns.
- Add tasks with a title, description, and status using a modal dialog.
- Enjoy a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- Switch between dark and light modes with a single click.
- Get real-time form validation feedback when entering task data.

This project is entirely frontend-based and does not rely on any backend or database. It can serve as a starter template for more complex productivity applications or as a lightweight tool for personal task tracking.

The layout uses Flexbox and CSS Grid for a modern, responsive feel. All modal functionality, form handling, and validation are written in vanilla JavaScript. Dark mode is toggled with local storage persistence.
